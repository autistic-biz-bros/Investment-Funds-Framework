# Investment-Funds-Framework

The contents are basically a map of VC investments. It was last edited in Febuary, so it requires updating.

Use Obsidian app to open the contents.

If you are going to add to the framework, leave a note in the repo so we dont have people editing over one another. I was unable to upload it for some reason, possibly due to the amount of files, but could be helpful to allow multiple people to edit at the same time.

The process is as follows:
1. Create a temporary account on Crunchbase (5 day trial)
2. Input the contents of VC's into the Framework (including investment)
3. Cross match with thier websites or other sources (news).

The idea is to create a map, so you can identify top performing VC's and where they allocate funds. If a VC performs particularly well and/or has thier bags pumped you can then be sure other projects they have invested in are to perform well, at least thats the idea. Also to identify the amount invested into particular projects. VC's tend to expect a hefty return on thioer investments, because it is unregulated, there is no upper limit.

I will try and keep this alive. This will be the most useful during the coming bear. Hopefully we can expand on it and create somthing good.
